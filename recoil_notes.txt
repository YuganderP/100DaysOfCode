We usecontext api not to optimize the rendering but to make the syntax look good and prevent prop drilling. 


State Management: 
it is the cleaner way to store the state of a the application. 
it lets you to teleport the state variable. 

State logic is different from the component logic. 

Recoil is one of the state management libraries. 
other state management libraries: 
Zustand and redux. 
The state management libraries lets you to divide your whole project into 2 components 
State and components 

Recoil has an concept of an atom. 
an atom can be defined outside the component and can be teleported to any component. 


steps:

Creating an atom:

atom ---------------------> simillar to useState ( which lets you create a the state variable)


atom is defined outside the component tree. 

only components which are using the atoms are re-rendered.
