common hooks: 
use effect,usecallback, useMemo, custom hooks,
Prop drilling

side effects:
in react we write many functions, the functions which perform other things
other than rendering action are called side effects

set interval, fetch

hooks: 
Previously we used to have react class based components and have access to react lifecycle methods.
to give us access to the life cycle methods while writing functional components we use hooks. 
example: componnets has mounted, updated. 

commanly used hooks:
useState
useEffect
usecallback
useMemouseRef
useContext

useState: for state variable management

useEffect: 
it allows you to perform side effects in function components 

useeffect ~ serves same purpose as componentDidmount(),ComponentDidUpdate(),ComponentWillUnmound()

use effect( ()=>{},[dependencies array])

dependencies array should contain state variables
