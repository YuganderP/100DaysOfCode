React Returns:
In react we can only return only single element 
The single top level element can contain multiple child siblings 
The react component cannot return multiple siblings

Reason: 
To make it easy to do reconcilation
reconcilation:The process of react figuring out what changes need to be made to DOM
as the application functions
 
 
React Fragment 
<> </>
// 
<React.Fragment> <React.Fragment />

Re-Reandering in react :

install React dev tools.

React -> Creates dynamic websites;

When the state changes the component dependent on the state changes: Re-Reander
We need make sure that the re-renders are minimized;



React hooks : are the functions introduced that allow 
React functional components to use state and other react features without 
writing classes 


using unique for the components :

if we done use key to the components when ever the order of the data is changed 
the react doesn't know that and I won't be able to rearrange them 


React memo: 
Higher order Component 
memoized the rendered output of a component preventing unnecessary re-renders
when the component's props haven't been changed.
it caches the rendered output of the component


Wrapper components 

useEffect Hook
