React Returns:
In react we can only return only single element 
The single top level element can contain multiple child siblings 
The react component cannot return multiple siblings

Reason: 
To make it easy to do reconcilation
reconcilation:The process of react figuring out what changes need to be made to DOM
as the application functions
 
 
React Fragment 
<> </>
// 
<React.Fragment> <React.Fragment />

Re-Reandering in react :

install React dev tools.

React -> Creates dynamic websites;

When the state changes the component dependent on the state changes: Re-Reander
We need make sure that the re-renders are minimized;



React hooks : are the functions introduced that allow 
React functional components to use state and other react features without 
writing classes
